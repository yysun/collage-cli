# Implementation Plan: Page-Based Loop - Major Redesign

## Overview
This plan implements a complete architectural transformation of collage-cli from photo-centric to page-centric processing. The redesign fundamentally changes how the system approaches collage creation, prioritizing optimal page layouts and intelligent photo assignment over sequential photo processing.

## Architectural Redesign Strategy

### Current Architecture Issues
- **Photo-First Thinking**: Main loop processes photos sequentially, limiting layout optimization

### New Page-Centric Architecture
1. **Page Planning Phase**: Analyze entire photo collection to determine optimal page strategy
2. **Smart Layout Generation**: Create layouts based on available photo characteristics
3. **Intelligent Photo Assignment**: Use weighted scoring for optimal photo-layout matching
